During my work in the lab I:
- loaded the features from the audio-files, using librosa
- implemented several ML models and applied methods of upsampling and downsampling

What I learned:
- basically I had no ML-skills, so everything that I've done is a product of learning

What could have been done better:
- when I started to work on the project, I didn't know the basics of working with data for ML, so I spent a lot of time on 
correcting very basic mistakes (like standartization, looking at accuracy, lack of val sample)
- it would have been more effective to learn more about the specifics of data and the applications
