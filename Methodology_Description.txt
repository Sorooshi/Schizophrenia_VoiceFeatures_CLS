# Methodology:


Please, use  Sklearn to implement, at least the 4 first below-mentioned algorithms in the form of a Python script.

- Jupyter notebooks are NOT accepted as final implementations. 

- If you are interested, you can consult my recent python package for detecting dyslexia (DD) to shape the structure of your project and create your test beds:

DD repo: https://github.com/Sorooshi/DD


Please:

- provide a list of features not less than 10 no more than 30 from https://librosa.org/doc/latest/feature.html;

- provide a brief description of each;

- provide a list of evaluation metrics for your task;




Methods to implement:

1) Logistic Regression 
2) Support Vector Machine
3) Random Forest 
4) MLP
5) you propose
6) you propose




- Tune the parameters using "Bayesian Search Optimization" in a five fold-cross validation framework. 

- Train and test using a 10-fold-cross validation framework.
